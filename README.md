# Advanced-Real-Time-Traffic-Monitoring-and-Adaptive-Signal-Control-System
 Traffic congestion in urban areas has emerged as a 
serious concern because of the increasing number of vehicles and 
inefficiency of conventional fixed-timer traffic signals that do not 
learn from present traffic conditions. In response, a smart traffic 
control system based on YOLOv8, a highly evolved object 
detection model, is proposed. The system examines real-time video 
streams to detect and categorize cars in given lane segments, tally 
them, and modify the green signal lengths according to traffic 
density in each lane. The adaptive real-time approach improves 
road flows, decreases crossing times at intersections, lessens fuel 
consumption, and enhances road efficiency. By making use of 
computer vision and artificial intelligence, the suggested solution 
presents a scalable and versatile design that can be integrated into 
existing city infrastructure, making way for smarter and more 
responsive urban traffic management systems.
